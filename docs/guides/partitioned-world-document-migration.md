# Partitioned world document and workspace model (WST-009.2)

## Ownership and consumers

`Horo/Editor/PartitionedWorldWorkspace.h` belongs to `HoroEditorModel`
(`HoroEngine::EditorModel`). It provides a headless, stateful Editor workspace model,
not another runtime admission validator. The model owns one optional
`PartitionedWorldDocument` and a separate transient open-page working set. Application
composition can own this model and expose its typed operations to later workspace UI
or automation adapters; this change does not add a GUI route or replace
`EditorWorkspaceController`'s existing scene document.

The new public dependency is EditorModel -> WorldStreaming for inert identities,
source-page heads, object descriptors, layer values, bounds, grid policy and checked
revision arithmetic. There is no reverse dependency and no runtime discovery,
mount, registration, callback or asset resolution. Existing consumers rebuild; no
previous API, persisted project version or file format changes. Header ownership,
standalone-header compilation, typed consumer assertions and the dependency allowlist
are updated together.

## Source metadata, not cooked state

- Settings own the stable `WorldPartitionId`, ordered canonical millimeter content
  bounds and validated authored grid policy. Bounds must fit that grid's level-zero
  envelope.
- Layers retain stable `StreamingLayerId`, owned UTF-8 names and typed layer metadata.
  Renaming or reordering does not regenerate IDs. Unknown ownership/flags,
  contradictory client/server flags and invalid priorities fail closed.
- Each page owns an exact `WorldAuthoringPageDescriptor` and its metadata-only object
  records. Object identity is `WorldAuthoringObjectAddress` (page asset plus nonzero
  local ID), not `sourceAsset`, a display name, vector index or runtime entity handle.
  The same local object number may be used in different pages.
- Every object record belongs to its page's exact immutable revision and an existing
  stable layer. Descriptor-version and placement failures retain their original
  WorldStreaming error identity.
- Empty worlds, empty pages and unloaded geometry are representable. No cooked cells,
  chunk package assets or `WorldPartitionDescriptor` are required. The latter remains
  an immutable **runtime** projection of `world.index`, not an editable document.
- Open pages are a distinct transient vector of admitted page asset IDs. Closing an
  open page never deletes its source metadata or changes authored dirty state. Runtime
  residency/eviction has no mutation capability into this owner.

Version one uses the spatial-page / revision-checked decision in
[World Authoring Source And Collaboration Contract](../architecture/runtime/world-streaming-architecture.md#world-authoring-source-and-collaboration-contract).
Page assets are independent of cooked `StreamingCellId`; future bake may map pages and
cells many-to-many without renaming either source identity.

## Transactions and fences

The host supplies a never-reused workspace `AssetId` to the owner constructor. It is
an incarnation identity, not the world or page identity. Every immutable snapshot has
an exact `{owner, WorldDocumentGeneration, WorldDocumentRevision}` fence. These types
are distinct from page revisions, mounted partition epochs and runtime residency
generations. Callers must capture the newest snapshot before every mutation.

`Open` validates and copies a complete source aggregate. A second Open is a conflict,
never an implicit discard. `Commit` is the one complete typed metadata transaction:
settings, layers, page/object additions, replacements and removals are checked together.
The partition identity cannot be edited; changing worlds requires `Replace`.
Unchanged pages retain identical heads and object records. Every changed existing
page must name its exact non-wrapping revision successor. Removed pages are pruned
from the working set in the same publication, so no dangling open-page IDs escape.

`SetWorkingSet` checks distinct page membership and the open-page ceiling without
altering authored metadata or dirty state. Both source commits and working-set changes
advance the publication revision, fencing stale commands across either kind of change.
Exact no-ops retain the existing lease and revision. Source commits set dirty; no
operation pretends to save or establish filesystem durability.

All validation and preparation precede the one immutable-root publication. Invalid,
unsupported, conflicting, stale, over-capacity and cancelled requests preserve the
previous root, dirty state, working set and generation. C++ allocation exceptions also
have this strong guarantee; they propagate rather than fabricating a success or trying
to allocate an out-of-memory diagnostic. Stop tokens are checked at admission and
immediately before publication. This is synchronous bounded tooling work, not a job
queue, and cancellation does not roll back an already completed publication.

## Lifecycle and limits

All service access belongs to the constructing thread. Wrong-thread calls reject
before touching mutable state; synchronized readers consume only immutable leases.
The owner cannot be copied or moved. Retained leases remain usable after edits,
replacement, close, shutdown and destruction; historical retention budgets belong to
the consuming service.

`Replace` requires the current fence and explicit `Discard` for dirty metadata. It
validates the new document first, then issues a fresh generation, clean admission state
and empty working set. Failed replacement preserves the previous document. `Close`
also requires the exact fence and dirty decision; reopening issues a fresh generation.
Generations and publication revisions never wrap.

`BeginCancellation` permanently gates new opens, commits, replacements and working-set
changes, but retains queries and permits explicit Close/Shutdown. `Shutdown` is
idempotent; a dirty-preserving failure does not change lifecycle or release state.
Explicit discard releases ownership, not reader snapshots. Destruction releases only
owned memory and invokes no external callbacks or persistence.

Default limits are also hard maxima: 256 layers, 4,096 page metadata records, 65,536
object descriptors, 65,536 aggregate layer-name bytes and 64 open pages. Hosts may
choose smaller nonzero ceilings. These bound **metadata**, not geometry or payload
residency. Input counts and aggregate byte ceilings are checked before owned copying;
no frame-time or streaming-performance claim is made.

## Validation and scope

Build `HoroPartitionedWorldWorkspaceTests`, `HoroEditorModelPublicHeaderConsumer`,
`HoroWorldStreamingTests` and `HoroWorldStreamingPublicHeaderConsumer`, then run:

```sh
ctest --test-dir build/skeleton -R 'Horo(PartitionedWorldWorkspace|WorldStreaming)Tests' --output-on-failure --no-tests=error
```

The focused tests exercise owned-copy admission, exact/overflow capacities, malformed
and unsupported metadata, stable IDs, atomic settings/layer/page/object transactions,
page successor/exhaustion, stale and foreign owner fences, independent working sets,
no-op revisions, cancellation, dirty preservation, replacement, reopen, shutdown,
wrong-thread rejection and retained readers. The consumer asserts const leases and
type separation using only declared EditorModel dependencies.

This is the complete metadata/workspace foundation, not manual cell payload I/O,
load/unload/pinning (#1635), the cell browser UI (#1630), bake, persistence,
undo/redo history, source-control merge, crash recovery or runtime preview activation.
Those services must consume exact immutable source revisions and must not clear dirty
metadata without their own durable publication contract.

## Layer command and outliner projection migration (WST-009.4)

The existing workspace now owns `WorldLayerCommand` and its exact semantic layer
history. There is no second document, mutable panel-owned layer table or independent
selection authority. `CreateWorldLayer` takes a host-issued `StreamingLayerId`,
validated descriptor and insertion ordinal. `ReorderWorldLayer` takes stable identity
and a final ordinal in the complete authored order, including filtered-out rows.
`FilterWorldLayers` selects a bounded, exact UTF-8 substring and optional typed
ownership. `SetCurrentWorldLayer` selects an admitted identity or explicitly clears
context. Filtering never changes context; it may hide the current layer.
`VisibleLayers` projects stable IDs in authored order. Names are presentation values,
never identities. The caller resolves IDs against its captured immutable snapshot.

`ExecuteLayerCommand` and `ReplayLayerCommand` require the same owner/generation/
publication fence as other workspace mutations. They prepare the complete candidate
and history before publishing. Bad descriptors, missing IDs, stale fences, unsupported
filters, capacity overflow and cancellation preserve the exact old lease, context,
working set and history. A no-op preserves revision and redo. Undo/redo restore exact
layer-section values rather than replaying UI input, while publication revisions
continue increasing. Source edits mark dirty and undo restores the pre-command dirty
state; transient filter/context edits never mark authored metadata dirty.

History retains at most 128 transactions and 4 MiB of charged semantic metadata,
including before/after layer descriptors and name/filter bytes. Oldest entries are
evicted before a newly reserved transaction is committed. A new command drops redo;
a failed command does neither. Pages, objects, working-set changes and runtime data
are never retained in layer history. Complete external metadata commits clear the
layer history and clear a removed current identity. Unchanged complete commits leave
history intact. Working-set changes preserve history, and replay preserves the
current working set. Replacement and close clear history/context; cancellation gates
commands/replay but preserves immutable queries until explicit teardown.

This additive C++ contract remains in the existing `HoroEditorModel` header and target.
Existing consumers rebuild; no persisted schema or backend dependency changes.
The public consumer fixture covers command, replay and projection signatures.
Run `HoroPartitionedWorldWorkspaceTests` and build
`HoroEditorModelPublicHeaderConsumer` to validate the new contract.

The foundational PR does not yet connect a partitioned-world document to the live
`EditorWorkspaceController` or panel host. This change provides the actual headless
command/history workflow against its real document authority; visible create-modal,
filter, reorder and authoring-context panel wiring still requires that admission/
host composition. It is not evidence of a completed graphical WST-009.4 workflow.
